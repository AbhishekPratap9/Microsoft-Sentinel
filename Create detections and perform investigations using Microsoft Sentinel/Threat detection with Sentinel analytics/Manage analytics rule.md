### Manage analytics rules
To adjust the noise and filter the more important threats detected, you should manage the analytics rules on an ongoing basis. This helps ensure that your rules remain useful and efficient in detecting potential security threats.<br>
You can perform the following four actions on existing active rules:
* Edit - You can modify existing rules by selecting Edit in the details pane. To edit a rule, you navigate the same pages that you did in creating the rule.
* Disable - can disable a rule when you're performing an activity that can trigger the rule alert. 
* Duplicate - When you duplicate a rule, the rule contains all the configuration provided from the original rule.
* Delete - Deleting the rule prompts you for confirmation before Microsoft Sentinel Analytics removes it from the set of active rules.
