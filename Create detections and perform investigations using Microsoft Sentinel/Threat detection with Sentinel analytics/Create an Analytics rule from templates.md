### Exploring the existing rule templates
 Can use some of the existing rule templates to create a single rule and others to create multiple rules with different customization options. Templates in use display the IN USE label on the template page

selecting one of the rules on the Rule Templates tab, you can observe the properties of the rule. For each rule, you can review:
* Severity level
  * High
  * Medium
  * Low
  * Informational
* Name of the rule
* Rule type
  * Anomaly
  * Fusion
  * Microsoft Security
  * ML Behavior Analytics
  * Scheduled
* Data Source
* Tactics
### Creating an analytic rule from a rule template
When you select a predefined rule template, the details pane may display filters that can be used to define how that rule behaves. For Fusion and ML behavior analytics rules, Microsoft doesn't provide any editable information. However, for scheduled rules and Microsoft Security, you can view or edit the query, filters, and includes and excludes used in the threat detection.
