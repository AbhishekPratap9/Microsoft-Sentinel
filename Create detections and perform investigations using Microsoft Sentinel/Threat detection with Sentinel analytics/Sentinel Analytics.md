* Analytics helps you detect, investigate, and remediate cybersecurity threats.
* You can analyze historical data collected from your workstations, servers, networking devices, firewalls, intrusion prevention, sensors, and so on. Microsoft Sentinel Analytics analyzes data from various sources to identify correlations and anomalies.
* **Analytics Rules**
  * By using analytics rules, you can trigger alerts based on the attack techniques that are used by known malicious actors. You can set up these rules to help ensure your SOC is alerted to potential security incidents in your environment in a timely fashion.

### Security Analytics use cases:
* Identification of compromised accounts
* User behavior analysis to detect potentially suspicious patterns
* Network traffic analysis to locate trends indicating potential attacks
* Detection of data exfiltration by attackers
* Detection of insider threats
* Investigation of incidents
* Threat hunting
